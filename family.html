            <h3>My Beloved Family</h3><br>
            <p>I am the second child out of two siblings, but I am also known as the adorable and beloved youngest in the family. Because I am the sweet and pretty youngest child, I tend to be less independent and often need someone to accompany me wherever I go.
I am truly grateful to be born into such a loving and happy family. Without my parents and my sister, I would not be where I am today. </p> <br>
 <p> I am also thankful for my extended family especially my grandparents, aunt, and cousins that always by my side and who guide me whenever I need support.
Without them, I wouldn’t be able to enjoy all the delicious meals they always treat me to. I love my big family dearly, and I hope that one day I will be able to build my own family and give them the same love and warmth that I have been blessed with. My family is my biggest support and happiness. 
                Every moment with them creates memories I cherish forever.</p>
