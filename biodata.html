    <h1>Hi, I'm Tikayy!</h1><br>
    <h3>Who Am I?</h3><br>
    <p>Hi, my name is Nooratika Shahira Binti Yazid, a student of UiTM Merbok,I am a final semester diploma student in Information Management. For the IMD318 subject project, I was assigned to create a personal website under the guidance of Sir Anaqi.</p> <br>
    <p>Building my personal website using HTML and CSS has taught me many useful skills. I learned how to structure a webpage using different HTML tags and how to design the layout, colors and fonts with CSS. 
	This project also improved my creativity because I had to think about how to make the website look attractive and user-friendly. Throughout the process, I developed problem-solving skills by fixing errors and adjusting the code whenever something didn’t work. 
	I also gained confidence in coding and became more familiar with using text editors and organizing files. Overall, creating my own website gave me hands-on experience and allowed me to express my identity and ideas through a clean and simple web design.</p>
